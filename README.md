# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Capstone Project 
This Repository contains the files for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree Capstone Project.

### 1. Motivation  
Since I am a technical student who often looks for advice on Stackoverflow I would like to learn a little more about the users. Stackoverflow does not allow private communication between users thus no personal conversations between users take place. The goal of this Project is to get to know the users of Stackoverflow a little better.

### 2. Installations
- [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- [Pandas](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
- [Matplotlib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
- [scikit-learn](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)
- [kmodes](https://pypi.org/project/kmodes/)

### 3. File Descriptions
- **BlogPost.md**: A blog post about my finding
- **Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that keeps my calculations and results

### 4. Findings
- *Python* and *Javascript* are the most rapidly growing programming languages.
- Older developers work from home more often than younger ones.
- The better the English level in a country, the higher the probability they will visit Stackoverflow

### 5. Acknowledgements
Thanks to [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) who made the survey results freely [availabe](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) and the survey participants.
