# Who are these people that answer your questions on Stackoverflow?

## Introduction
As a student of a technical course of studies [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is my starting point to get questions about a programming language answered. Since Stackoverflow does not provide private communication between users, little is known about them. This article tries to shed some light on this by using the Stackoverflow [2014](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B0DL28AqnGsrempjMktvWFNaQzA) and [2019](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QOmVDpd8hcVYqqUXDXf68UMDWQZP0wQV) survey data to answer three questions.

## Which programming languages have become more popular within the last 5 years?
As a student, one constantly asks oneself whether the acquired knowledge is also that which will be needed in the later job. Of course this also applies to programming languages. Therefore it would be interesting to know which programming languages have gained or lost popularity within the last five years. The following graphic will answer this question.

It is obvious that the languages *Python* and *Javascript* have gained significantly in popularity among Stackoverflow users over the last five years with an increase of 18.7% and 8.9% respectively. Among the losers are the programming languages *C#* and *Objective C*, which have a minus of 6% and 5.7%. So if you are looking for a seminal programming language for the next few years, *Python* or *Javascript* may your best bet.  

*Note: The surveys of 2014 and 2019 differ considerably in terms of questions and answer possibilities. Since the 2014 survey used the 11 programming languages listed here as the answer choice, these were also only compared with the values from 2019.*

## Do experienced developers tend to work from home and how has this changed over the last 5 years?
In times of COVID-19 many companies rely on home work of their employees. But how high was this rate before that time and has it changed within the last five years? Furthermore it shall be investigated whether there are differences regarding age. For example, one might think that experienced developers tend to work from home because their boss has known them longer or they have family to look after in parallel to their work.

The graph shows that the share of people under thirty who do not rely on distance work is actually higher than for older people. The proportion of those who work almost exclusively at a distance also appears to increase with age, with the exception of those under 20 years of age. It is interesting to note that a polarizing effect has been observed over the last five years. The number of those who either never or work completely at a remote location has increased.   

## Is Stackoverflow less used in European countries where the percentage of English language skills is considered lower?
Finally, it will be investigated whether the number of users on Stackoverflow in European non-English speaking countries depends on their knowledge of English. The ten countries with the absolute number of participants were used for this purpose. To ensure comparability between the countries, the number of participants in each country was set in relation to the number of inhabitants. The English level of the respective countries was taken from [this](https://www.ef.com/wwen/epi/) website.

As can be seen, the number of users from countries whose English skills are considered higher is more frequent (in relation to the respective number of inhabitants). One could conclude from this that the information on Stackoverflow is not accessible to those whose English skills are considered lower. Improving school education or integrating a translator into Stackoverflow could be actions to address this issue.   

*Assumption: The author assumes that the number of study participants per country is proportional to the number of Stackoverflow visitors who did not participate in the study. Furthermore, he assumes that the availability of the internet is the same in all 10 countries compared and that the share of developers in each country is the same.*


## Conclusion
In this article, we took a look at the 2014 and 2019 survey data to get an insight into the user base of Stackoverflow. 

1. *Python* and *Javascript* are the most rapidly growing programming languages.
2. Older developers work from home more often than younger ones.
3. The better the English level in a country, the higher the probability they will visit Stackoverflow
